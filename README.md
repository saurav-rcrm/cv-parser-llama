# CV Parser with LLM Models

A resume parsing application that uses multiple LLM models through Groq API to extract structured information from resumes.

## Features

### üöÄ Model Selection
- **GPT-20B**: OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20B model (default)
- **Llama 4 Scout**: Meta's Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct model
- Easy model switching through settings

### üîÑ Comparison Mode
- Parse resumes using both models simultaneously
- Side-by-side comparison of parsing results
- Performance metrics for each model
- Cost analysis and savings calculation

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Panel
- Accessible via the settings button (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top-right corner
- Model selection dropdown
- Comparison mode toggle
- Real-time configuration updates

### üìä Enhanced Analytics
- Detailed time metrics for each model
- Token usage tracking
- Cost comparison with Sovren
- Employment gap and overlap detection

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Groq API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd cv-parser-llama
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
cd resume-parser-frontend
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
# In the root directory
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here" > .env
```

4. Start the backend server:
```bash

```

## Usage

### Basic Parsing
1. Click the settings button (‚öôÔ∏è) to configure your preferred model
2. Upload one or more resume files (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
3. Click "Parse" to extract information
4. View the parsed results with detailed analytics

### Comparison Mode
1. Enable "Comparison Mode" in settings
2. Upload resumes as usual
3. Click "Parse & Compare" to process with both models
4. Use the tabs to switch between model results
5. Compare performance metrics and parsing accuracy

### Supported File Formats
- PDF (.pdf)
- Microsoft Word (.doc, .docx)

## API Endpoints

- `GET /models` - Get available models
- `POST /upload` - Parse resumes with single model
- `POST /upload/compare` - Parse resumes with all models for comparison
- `GET /health` - Health check

## Model Configuration

The application supports multiple models through Groq API:

```javascript
const AVAILABLE_MODELS = {
  "openai/gpt-oss-20b": {
    name: "gpt-20B",
    displayName: "GPT-20B",
    provider: "groq",
    isDefault: true
  },
  "meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct": {
    name: "llama-4-scout",
    displayName: "Llama 4 Scout",
    provider: "groq",
    isDefault: false
  }
};
```

## Features in Detail

### Employment Analysis
- Automatic detection of employment gaps
